Cool Drive - UseTheBoost Prototype:
Changelog

-A tutorial level has been added, accessible from the instructions screen

-Default skybox has been replaced with an actual skybox, to represent sunset

-The directional global light has been rotated to reflect this.

-All of the "pads" have had their materials reworked. They should now give off a faint glow.

-The magnitude of the effects of some of these pads have been adjusted.

-Boost, Downforce, and Overclock abilities, along with their associated backend requirements, have been imported from the previous previous version of this project

-The Boost ability now has a cooldown icon. Icons for Downforce and Overclock are planned, and will be implemented as soon as I can think of succinct, 64px x 64px representations. Until then, those abilities are disabled.

-Apartment buildings have been added to the scene to imply that this is taking place in a repurposed construction zone
